# SFPD-Data-Analysis
For the Capital One MindSumo challenge.

## Data Exploration
All data exploration was performed using an iPython notebook (Analysis.ipynb)

## Data Visualization
Data visualization was performed using matplotlib, numpy, pandas, and seaborn.
All relevant code can be found in (visualize.py)

## Web Programming
I utilized Flask for a lightweight server backend, and used its built-in Jinja2
templating, and Jquery for necessary Javascript. No need for fancy libraries, since
it's mostly just a data presentation website.
